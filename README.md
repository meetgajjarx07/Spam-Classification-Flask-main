## About The Project
![Spam_Classifier_Home](https://github.com/meetgajjarx07/Spam-Classification-Flask-main/assets/135112807/beb7cb01-ce2f-4019-8271-e94213b6e20f)


Spam, or unwanted commercial or mass e-mail, has recently become a major issue on the internet. Spam is a waste of time, storage space, and data transfer capacity.

Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical strategy for e-mail filtering. They commonly use a bag of words feature to identify spam e-mail. As a consequence, we'll build a rudimentary message classifier using the Naive Bayes theory.
